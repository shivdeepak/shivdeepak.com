I love in-flight internet. It is easy to focus when you are on a flight, and if you have internet, no one can stop you from being uber-productive.

But. In-flight internet is usually slow and flaky, and most websites load slowly or do not.

And that brings me to today. I am flying to Paris on Air France, and the in-flight internet is very slow. Almost no website loads properly. Not even Github. ðŸ˜­

And on ChatGPT, I see these network errors! ðŸ˜–

So, I have 8+ hours to kill and no reliable Internet. What do I do? Sleep? â€” wrong answer! I wrote a command line client for ChatGPT that uses ChatGPT API. This client makes low-bandwidth API calls to ChatGPT without loading the website.

I love how generative AI is improving our lives, one day at a time!
