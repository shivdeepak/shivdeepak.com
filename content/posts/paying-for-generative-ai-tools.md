I had a fascinating conversation today.

A few months ago, someone told me that Generative AI is the most significant invention since the dawn of the internet. I have been highly skeptical about this outlook for a while.

However, today, when seeking advice from a talented content writer friend regarding a piece of content I was working on, I mentioned that I had already dedicated almost a day to it. She suggested trying Notion AI, which could save me a lot of time. So I gave it a try, and it was amazing! This led to the following conversation:

I am already paying for three different Generative AI tools, each serving a different purpose. Every time I use my credit card, I feel like the money was well spent. However, I keep coming across new products that blow my mind and do an even better job. One observation I made is that, apart from ChatGPT, all the other tools excel at one specific thing, surpassing ChatGPT in that particular area.

Itâ€™s interesting to think that when the internet first came out, people were not paying subscription fees like this! So, I have no doubt that Generative AI will revolutionize technology in the next several years and drive innovation in Silicon Valley.
