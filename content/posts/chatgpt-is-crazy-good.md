I have heard people say that ChatGPT has the potential to kill Google Search, and I thought that’s absurd, and it’s not going to happen. After all, Google Search is great, and I have never had any major complaints about it. You don’t need a solution to a problem you don’t have!

But I have heard so many things about ChatGPT that it’s hard for me to ignore it any longer. Here is some major news coverage:

1. Dec 21, 2022 – [Is ChatGPT a threat to Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html) – NY Times
2. Jan 23, 2023 – [Microsoft Invests $10B in ChatGPT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) – NY Times
3. Feb 1, 2023 – [OpenAPI Announces ChatGPT Subscription](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23581561/chatgpt-plus-paid-option-20-openai-waitlist) – The Verge

So, I wanted to experiment with ChatGPT to see what it can and cannot do. I work on several tech stacks at my company, and it’s often hard to remember the APIs of every service I work with, and I spend a lot of time going through the documentation. And it takes several attempts with Google Search to find what I am looking for.

So, I decided to give ChatGPT a shot. Here are some examples of open-ended programming questions:

![How to write unit tests for AWS IoT core on Ruby on Rails](/posts/images/chatgpt-is-crazy-good/rails-aws-unit-tests.png)

So far, so good! It has done so much better than what Google could have done already!

But can it figure out creative solutions for problems that do not have a straightforward programming solution? Let’s give it a shot!

In this case, Chat GPT could have suggested Apple HomeKit Integration or a third-party integration with [Hoobs](https://hoobs.com/). But it couldn’t make this connection. But is it just a matter of time? I don’t know!

So, I don’t think ChatGPT can beat human creativity! It can be a great tool, but it cannot replace the person using it, at least not yet!

ChatGPT can be a great assistant for me as a programmer and maybe replace some Google searches. An excellent application for ChatGPT could be customer support bots! I can see that it will do a phenomenal job in most cases!

The bottom line is I am intrigued and want to play with it even more!!!
