Hi There,

I have been coding since high school and have a 20+ year programming background. I have built software myself and in a team and have also built and managed high-performance product engineering teams. Almost all of my professional career has been spent building and growing startups.

I am a big fan of building software that is self-sustainable and can grow itself. In my past roles, I have worked on Product Lead Growth, Gamification, Growth Hacking, and Cloud Cost Optimization.

I was very fortunate to join the first Y Combinator startup from India, HackerRank (YC S11). I have seen and contributed to its growth from a seed-stage startup with $0 ARR to an enterprise with tens of millions in ARR.

I love open-source software. In school, I contributed to the open-source project Sahana Eden and was selected for Google Summer of Code 2011, popularly known as GSoC. Only about 1000 students are selected for this program every year.

More recently, I built two startups. One was a Smart Home Device that I built in public and raised crowdfunding for. Another was an Intelligent Email for Sales that was part of Techstars NYC'23 and got the #4 product of the day on Product Hunt.

I am experienced in a vast range of tech stacks. I also love working with Python, Ruby, and Javascript. I am currently learning Rust. I am a big fan of Serveless and deeply experienced in leveraging Public Cloud (AWS and GCP). I can do front-end, backend, DevOps, and data engineering myself or mentor and manage engineers to do it.

I currently consult with SaaS startups and am open to collaborating on technical content.

Previously:
- Co-Founder & CTO at Touch AI (Techstars NYC'23) (Intelligent Email for Sales)
- Founder of Aeroh (Smart Home IoT Startup)
- Employee #1 at HackerRank (YC S11) (World's No. 1 Technical Assessment Platform)
- Student Developer, Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2011
